@title description Description

*fiss* must be run as Unix process no 1 if invoked without arguments and handles the boot process in user-land.

This happens in three stages:

@title stage Stage 1

*fiss* runs _/etc/fiss/start_ and waits for it to terminate. The system's one time tasks are done here. _/etc/fiss/start_ has full control of _/dev/console_ to be able to start an emergency shell if the one time initialization tasks fail. If _/etc/fiss/start_ crashes, *finit* will skip stage 2 and enter stage 3.

@title stage Stage 2

*fiss* starts all services in _/etc/fiss/service.d_ which should not return until system shutdown; if it crashes, it will be restarted.

@title stage Stage 3

If *fiss* is told to shutdown the system, it terminates stage 2 if it is running, and runs _/etc/fiss/stop_. The systems tasks to shutdown and possibly halt or reboot the system are done here. If stage 3 returns, *finit* checks if the file

@title signals Signals

*finit* only accepts signals in stage 2.

If *finit* receives a CONT signal and the file *finit*
is told to shutdown the system.

if *finit* receives an INT signal, *finit* restarts the system.
