fiss \- a UNIX process no 1
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\fB\fCfsvc\fR
when running as PID 0 (as init)
.PP
\fB\fCfsvc\fR <0|6>
when running regulary to controll init
.SH CONTROLLING
.PP
If \fB\fCfinit\fR is invoked by any other user than \fIroot\fP, it failes.
.PP
\fB\fCfinit\fR 0
halts the system
.PP
\fB\fCfinit\fR 6
reboots the system
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fB\fCfiss\fR must be run as Unix process no 1 if invoked without arguments and handles the boot process in user\-land.
.PP
This happens in three stages:
.SH STAGE 1
.PP
\fB\fCfiss\fR runs \fI/etc/fiss/start\fP and waits for it to terminate. The system's one time tasks are done here. \fI/etc/fiss/start\fP has full control of \fI/dev/console\fP to be able to start an emergency shell if the one time initialization tasks fail. If \fI/etc/fiss/start\fP crashes, \fB\fCfinit\fR will skip stage 2 and enter stage 3.
.SH STAGE 2
.PP
\fB\fCfiss\fR starts all services in \fI/etc/fiss/service.d\fP which should not return until system shutdown; if it crashes, it will be restarted.
.SH STAGE 3
.PP
If \fB\fCfiss\fR is told to shutdown the system, it terminates stage 2 if it is running, and runs \fI/etc/fiss/stop\fP\&. The systems tasks to shutdown and possibly halt or reboot the system are done here. If stage 3 returns, \fB\fCfinit\fR checks if the file
.SH SIGNALS
.PP
\fB\fCfinit\fR only accepts signals in stage 2.
.PP
If \fB\fCfinit\fR receives a CONT signal and the file \fB\fCfinit\fR
is told to shutdown the system.
.PP
if \fB\fCfinit\fR receives an INT signal, \fB\fCfinit\fR restarts the system.
