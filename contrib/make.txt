If you add a new c-binary or edit c-files, you probably have to modify its dependency-objects.
This is done by a comment somewhere in the source-file (see bin/fsvs.c) in this format:

// +objects: obj1.o obj2.o ...

This can be done multiple times if you got a lot of linker-dependencies.

For compile/linker-flags, use:

// +flags: -static -Werror
