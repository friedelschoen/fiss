The Documentation markup (in src/docs, src/man) isn't just Markdown or whatever but
an own language which is intended to be parsed really easy, don't expect a lot, it's just
some ' '-splitting and regex-replacing.
In this document I want to present the syntax.

Conversion is done with the scripts make-docs.py for html and make-man.py for obviously man

Blocks and Titles
=================

@header <text...>
